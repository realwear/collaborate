# Contributing to RealWear Collaborate

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RealWear Collaborate! We welcome contributions of all
kinds, including bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and more. By contributing, you
help make this project better for everyone.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the
codebase without affecting the original project.

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your
changes, such as `fix-bug-123` or `add-new-feature`.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Make your changes in your branch. Ensure your code adheres to the project's style guide and
conventions. Don’t forget to add or update tests if your changes affect functionality.

### 4. Test Your Changes

Run the tests locally to make sure everything works as expected.

```bash
yarn test
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Once you’re happy with your changes:

1. Push your branch to your forked repository.
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of this repository.

In your PR description:

- Clearly explain the purpose of the changes.
- Reference any relevant issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Include testing instructions, if applicable.

We encourage smaller, focused PRs rather than large, sweeping changes.
